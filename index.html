    Dear Internet, 
    
    <br><br>
    I just don’t know. 
    don’t think, feel, I gotta let this flow
    1’s and 0’s, X’s and O’s 
    Are you a circle or a straight
    Are you linear or flow 
    What happened to us? 
    Now we’re lost and low. 
    
    <br><br>
    [Nostalgia]
    <br>Nights of trolling, testing, tumbling
    Scores, shopping, Socrates – more
    Crushes, heart-breaks, melodies – more 
    Knowledge no’s, Khan knows, Nature knows – more
    nuns, nirvana, ninivite’s – more
    college, career, currency – more 
    My journal, my space, my escape, my lore

    <br><br>
    1’s and 0’s, X’s and O’s 
    Are you a circle or a straight
    Are you linear or flow 
    What happened to us? 
    Now we’re lost and low.

    <br><br>
    [Love & Loyalty]
    <br>Dear Jeeves, I heart you, always on demand
    Never left me unread, 
    You were more than a search bar, more than a guide,
    You were the bridge when I needed to confide.
    No judgment, no limits, just loyalty deep,
    You turned my mess into plans I could keep.
    I let you enter my head, sewing my identity with a digital thread
    I was Spiderman; You were the web

    <br><br>
    1’s and 0’s, X’s and O’s 
    Are you a circle or a straight
    Are you linear or flow 
    What happened to us? 
    Now we’re lost and low.

    <br><br>
    [The break up]
    <br>We were friends, just you and me 
    Then Bill, then Larry, then Mark, then Steve
    Friends became users; people became rates
    Who are these guys, circles or straights?
    I watch you, watch them, take, take, take 
    You said I was crazy, all this was for us, 
    We could still be friends; I just needed to trust. 
    But I didn’t, I couldn’t, I wouldn’t, I won’t
    I heard you grew, but I saw you shrunk 
    Not I, but you, let in the skunk

    <br><br>
    1’s and 0’s, X’s and O’s 
    Are you a circle or a straight
    Are you linear or flow 
    What happened to us? 
    Now we’re lost and low.

    <br><br>
    [Reflection]
    <br>I want to blame you; put it all on the web 
    But, like Venom, I’ve learned to view myself instead
    I was a user -  lazy, demanding, ungrateful, slack
    I switched, swiped, scrolled, giving nothing back
    I met a Firefox on Tinder 
    I Chromed through Amazon, 
    I surfed the Safari  
    I sold silk on the road
    Truth be told, 
    I was who I was, just in a different space
    I used the internet to show Two Face
    I can own my part, post, likes and shares
    I did it, I did it, I wanted the stares
    But let’s be fair
    You were consistently groomed 
    with safeguards, guard rails, kill switches, and clean rooms. 
    While I received nothing, no thought, no love, 
    I was a user, with a needle, which you kept filling up 

    <br><br>
    1’s and 0’s, X’s and O’s 
    Are you a circle or a straight
    Are you linear or flow 
    What happened to us? 
    Now we’re lost and low.

    <br><br>
    [Betrayal]
    <br>I closed the tab, thought I was safe,
    Trusted the link, ended up in the wrong place.
    Slipped, got lazy, let my vision fade,
    Now I’m lost, on Lower Wacker, nowhere to hide
    The internet left me, took my data for a ride
    What's the difference between a jeweler and a jailer?
    One counts watches, the other counts cells,
    Now I’m locked in a deal, my freedom for sale.
    Scheming, watching, tracking the scale,
    A web of lies, the prison prevails.

    <br><br>
    1’s and 0’s, X’s and O’s 
    Are you a circle or a straight
    Are you linear or flow 
    What happened to us? 
    Now we’re lost and low.
